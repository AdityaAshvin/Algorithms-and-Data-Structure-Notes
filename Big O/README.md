# Big O Notation

Big-O Notation gives an upper bound of the complexity in the worst case, helping to quantify performance as the input size becomes arbitarily larger

Constant Time: O(1)
Logarithmic Time: O(log(n))
Linear Time: O(n)
Quadric Time: O(n^2)
Cubic Time: O(n^3)
Exponential Time: O(b^n)
Factorial Time: O(n!)
